For a long time there were big barriers to international trade. At a time when governments struggled to raise tax from their own people, levying heavy import duties on things coming in from abroad was easier to implement.

If you are producing just for one country, your market is quite limited. But with trade, you can also start selling things to customers all over the world.

Some firms are really productive, others are really poorly managed. What happens when you have trade, is that you have much stronger competition.
