Social media let anyone broadcast their opinion as soon as they formulate one. Politicians can speak directly to their constituents—and their constituents can message them straight back.

Only 43% believed people should have that right on social media. University students shout down speakers they deem too offensive. Officials at the University of California, Berkeley cancelled a speech by Ann Coulter, a right-wing author, because they feared violent protests.

Wanting to shield others from offence is a laudable thing. As informal norms, politeness and civility are virtuous. But when being offensive becomes illegal, officials have to police a feeling. Since offence is subjective, the power to police can quickly become vast and arbitrary. And when people in free countries argue for restrictions on speech, authoritarian regimes find it easier to impose constraints. Sometimes this too is for ostensibly laudable reasons—to restrict and punish “hate speech”, for instance, or maintain harmony in a multiconfessional country. But all too often, governments that give themselves this power use it to protect themselves. Russia sentenced a blogger to five years’ imprisonment for promoting “extremism” after he questioned its meddling in Ukraine.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"The West, with its roots in the Enlightenment, remains the freest place in the world for scepticism about established dogmas and ill-founded taboos. But the impulse to tell people what they can’t say is strong too. Germany now requires websites to remove hate speech and fake news within 24 hours of being notified. Other European countries may follow suit. Sixteen countries have banned denying the Holocaust. In Britain, the Official Secrets Act opens newspapers to prosecution for publishing information that the government deems threatening to national security. After the Guardian published Edward Snowden’s pilfered secrets, employees from GCHQ, the national digital spying agency, marched into the newspaper’s offices and destroyed their hard drives.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Elsewhere, laws forbidding blasphemy help to squash free speech. Saudi Arabia publicly flogs blasphemers and those who dare denounce its austere interpretation of Sunni Islam. Indians can be jailed for three years for promoting disharmony “on the grounds of religion, race…caste…or any other ground whatsoever”. In Indonesia and Pakistan, anyone can file a claim of blasphemy against anyone else.

Religion is the central organising institution for many people. An insult to the faith cuts at the very fabric of society. But laws that turn people into criminals whenever someone else takes offence can all too easily become tools of repression. Although virtually every country promises its citizens freedom of speech, none delivers it entirely. Article 35 of China’s constitution promises every citizen “freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of procession and of demonstration”. Anyone who takes those words literally might embark on a career reporting on corruption among Communist Party officials. It would be nasty, brutish and short.

Contemporary free-speech sceptics, by contrast, want to stop people from expressing ideas that could make others feel “unsafe”—a far more nebulous standard. There is also a difference between how governments regulate speech and how platforms such as Twitter and Facebook should. They are global information conduits, used for good and ill. How to guard against malicious falsehoods while preserving as much access as possible for as many people? That remains a vital debate. Twitter recently deactivated accounts it believed belonged to bots; some American right-wingers cried suppression. But governments have the power to jail, bankrupt and censor under threat of violence. Private companies do not, and are free to set their own standards. If people feel discriminated against because of their politics, they can go elsewhere.
