Over the past two years, the government of Viktor Orban, Hungary’s increasingly autocratic prime minister, has passed laws requiring all non-profit groups that receive large donations from abroad to declare themselves foreign-funded organisations, and to post that information like a brand of shame on all printed or audiovisual materials they produce.
