Same-sex marriage is revolutionary only because heterosexuals have defined marriage for centuries.

The #MeToo movement has become a “witch hunt” that takes all accusations at face value and fails to give the accused a chance to defend themselves. Orwellian “thought police” are censoring political and social views, language, even Halloween costumes.

Indeed, the nativist rhetoric and anti-immigration impulses that animated both campaigns were a form of identity politicking. Around the world, increasing tolerance towards minority groups has been met with similar backlashes. Reported hate crimes against LGBT groups have risen in Britain and America even as gay marriage has been legalised. In India the ruling BJP party accommodates hard-line Hindus sometimes at the expense of the Muslim minority.
